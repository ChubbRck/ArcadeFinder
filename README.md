ArcadeFinder
============

ArcadeFinder is a mobile web app to locate and tag arcade games near you. Written by Nick Santaniello in Spring 2011.

ArcadeFinder is written with Javascript, JQuery, and a little PHP to query a MySQL database. It uses the Google Maps API in conjunction with the Yelp API to populate data regarding reported venues.
